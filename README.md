# Dude Bot (WIP)
A multi-purpose Discord bot themed after Jeff Lebowski, aka The Dude.

Current notable features:

- Automated message routines (send custom messages automatically based on custom keywords)

- Reminders, available both in offset and non-offset format (5 minutes from now vs 7 pm tonight)

- Automated greeting messages when a new user joins

- Simple management of roles that exist purely to give usernames colors

- Detailed help command that can provide information about any command, subcommand, or even specific parameter

- And of course, a command to trigger a random The Big Lebowski quote
