# Dude Bot
A multi-purpose Discord bot, with the great Jeffrey Lebowski as its avatar.

This readme is WIP.

Current notable features:
Automated message routines (send custom messages automatically based on custom keywords)
Reminders, available both in offset and non-offset format (5 minutes from now vs 7 pm tonight)
New user join messages
Color role management
And of course, a command to trigger a random The Big Lebowski quote
