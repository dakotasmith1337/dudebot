The recommended commands to restrict are add/delete for routines, colors, and reminder channels, reminder settings, and new user join settings.\n\n**/help Usage:**\nThis command prints this message and shows the top level commands, or provides information on a given command.\n\nTo view information for a specific command, use /help <command> where <command> is the command you want information on.\n\nThis works for subcommands and arguments as well as top level commands.\n\nFor example, '/help routine', '/help routine view', '/help routine view one', and '/help view one trigger' are all valid /help commands."
