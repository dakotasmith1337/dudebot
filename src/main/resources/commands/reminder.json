			"long_description": "This command adds a reminder for a specific time or a specific amount of time from now, based on the value of the 'offset' argument. The reminder message will be sent in the channel the add command is used in. Each user may only have three active reminders at a time, and a reminder *may* not go off at the exact time it is given; see the 'Why so strict?' section below.\n\nNOTE: Reminder time precision does not go beyond minutes, which may not be intuitive when 'offset' is true and 'minute' is provided. E.g. setting a 10 minute reminder at 11:49:30 will cause the reminder to go off at 12:00, not 11:59:30.\n\nWhen 'offset' is false, if any of the time components are left null, they default to the soonest possible value that is in the future based on the other components. For example, if you leave year null, it will default to the current year if the month, day, hour, and minute components would result in a time in the future, otherwise it will default to next year. The only exception to this is the most granular argument, minute, which will default to :00.\n\n**Why so strict?**\nDiscord only allows bots to send 50 requests per second, meaning scalability is a major concern for this feature, primarily around major spikes. For example, if this bot becomes popular, it is not hard to imagine hundreds or even thousands of servers using this feature to send a message along the lines of '@everyone Happy New Year!' at 12:00 a.m. on January 1st. It is for this reason that reminders are limited to 3 per user. However, Dude does his best to provide what guarantees he can: reminders are sent out on a 'first added, first served' basis, and the add confirmation message will inform you of your reminder's place in the queue for that minute."

Each user is allowed 3 reminders total. Within guilds, reminder admins can configure which channels are acceptable for reminders to be used.
